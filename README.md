# path_dependent_missions

This repository contains the models and tools necessary to perform aero-thermal-mission optimizations.
Specifically, it contains Dymos, propulsion, and aerodynamic models for the Efficient Supersonic Air Vehicle (ESAV) platform.
This code has been used as the basis for a conference paper on the optimal mission for a thermally constrained aircraft.
